<p ALIGN="CENTER"> <a name="n2"></a><b>Gameplay</b> </p>
<p> 
     It's very easy to play this game, the basic operations are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>  1. In the weird market you can buy commodities (1 or more).</li>
<li>  2. Switch places (like<b> Dundus</b>) by juct clicking on the corresponding button.</li>
<li>  3. Check the prices in the weird market, if cheap, buy it and sell it in other places; if expensive, sell it in that area to earn money.
<li>  4. Iterate 1 & 2 & 3 </li>
     <br>Finally, the system will calculate the total money you have (cash+deposit), if you are rich enough, you can enter the game ranking list, your goal is to be wealthy!</br>
</ul>
<p>Mention that each time you switch places, it will pass 1 day, therefore you need to be cautious to maximize your profit</p>
<p><a name="n00">It's easy to play, but not easy to improve the skills.</a> It's challenging to earn a huge amount of money. You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.<font color="blue"><b>Investigate the prices for each commodity</b></font>, so that you are able to "buy low and sell high" For example, 
if you bought water in $20 and if you find that in another area water is $50, you can earn by selling water in this area.
     As time goes, you will be familliar with the price intervals of the commodities.</li>
<li>2.<font color="blue"><b>Business opportunities from events, </b></font>there are many random events will affect the commodity price. For example, 
   "The cold wave is coming! Diesel is urgently needed for power generation and heating." event will make Diesel price increased by 7 times. 
   Another example is that "Depression pervades every part of local community.", this will make drug price increase 3 times.
   </li>
<li>3.<font color="blue"><b>Remember to expand your business scale</b></font>. 
First, at the early stage, you earn money by importing some cheap goods like water and clothes, but remember to import some more expensive commodities 
like weapons and computers, those goods has larger price interval and therefore more opportunities to earn money.
Second, originnally you only have 100 storehouse size, remember to expand your storehouse size, so that you are able to store more and earn more.</li>
<li>4.<font color="blue"><b>Use other strategies, </b></font> for more info see <a href="#n51">Strategies</a>¡£</li>     
</ul>
